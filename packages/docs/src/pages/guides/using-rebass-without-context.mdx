# Using Rebass without Context

If you'd like to use Rebass components without adding a theme to React context,
you can pass a `theme` object as a prop to any of the components.

<Note>

This guide is a work-in-progress.
If you'd like to help make this better,
please open an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/rebassjs/rebass).

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Box } from 'rebass'
import theme from './theme'

export default props =>
  <Box
    {...props}
    theme={theme}
  />
```
