# Theming

Rebass components are built with themeability in mind.
All colors, typographic styles, layout styles, and component variants can be completely customized with theming.

## ThemeProvider

To apply themes to Rebass components, add a [ThemeProvider][] component to the root of your application and pass a `theme` object as a prop.

If you're using Emotion by itself, install the `emotion-theming` package.
If you're using Rebass with [Theme UI][], use its `ThemeProvider` or the `gatsby-plugin-theme-ui` package.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import theme from './theme'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react'
// or for use with Theme UI:
// import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'

export default props =>
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    {props.children}
  </ThemeProvider>
```

Rebass follows the [Theme Specification][],
which allows you to define thematic values in a more portable format.
Themes created for [Styled System][] or [Theme UI][] will work with Rebass with no additional configuration required.
This also means that themes created for use with Rebass will work in other applications that follow the same specification.

## Example

The following is an example theme, showing *some* of the design constraints that can be defined as scales,
including colors, typography, layouts, and variants.

```js
// example theme.js
export default {
  breakpoints: ['40em', '52em', '64em'],
  fontSizes: [
    12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64
  ],
  colors: {
    blue: '#07c',
    lightgray: '#f6f6ff'
  },
  space: [
    0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256
  ],
  fonts: {
    body: 'system-ui, sans-serif',
    heading: 'inherit',
    monospace: 'Menlo, monospace',
  },
  fontWeights: {
    body: 400,
    heading: 700,
    bold: 700,
  },
  lineHeights: {
    body: 1.5,
    heading: 1.25,
  },
  shadows: {
    small: '0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, .125)',
    large: '0 0 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, .125)'
  },
  variants: {
  },
  text: {
  },
  buttons: {
    primary: {
      color: 'white',
      bg: 'primary',
    }
  }
}
```

## Preset

To quickly get started without creating a custom theme, install the Rebass Preset package and use it in place of a custom theme.

```sh
npm i @rebass/preset
```

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'emotion-theming'
import preset from '@rebass/preset'

export default props =>
  <ThemeProvider theme={preset}>
    {props.children}
  </ThemeProvider>
```

## Demo

Edit the theme in the demo below to see how colors, space, and typographic scales affect the Button component.

```jsx live=true
<ThemeProvider
  theme={{
    colors: {
      background: 'black',
      primary: 'tomato',
    },
    space: [ 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 ],
    fontSizes: [ 14, 16, 18, 20, 24 ],
    radii: {
      default: 12,
    }
  }}>
  <Button>Beep</Button>
</ThemeProvider>
```
